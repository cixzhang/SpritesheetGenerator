# Installation

Requires node.js. After installing node.js:
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
```

# Running the server
```
grunt spritesheet
```
Visit `http://localhost:8000`

# To use
Drag and drop your sprite (image) file into the application. Use the tools available to draw frames. The detail panel will show each frame and allow you to set its name or delete a frame.

After you're done editing, the JSON output will be displayed in the files panel.

If you're editing an already existing spritesheet JSON, you can drag and drop it into the application window and your frames will be populated.
